              <p>
                  After a few months of running our 21 Questions app in late 2023, Mehul and I started seeing some early traction. People were actually using it. We had an idea, what if we turned this into a physical card game?
              </p>

              <p>
                  Neither of us had ever designed or manufactured a physical product before, but we were curious enough to give it a shot.
              </p>

              <h3>Finding our angle</h3>

              <p>
                  We decided our first deck would be targeted at couples. We started by researching competitors like "We're Not Really Strangers" and "Substance" to understand what resonated with their audiences. After a few weeks of mocking up designs in Figma, we felt ready to find a manufacturer.
              </p>

              <h3>The manufacturing hunt</h3>

              <p>
                  We turned to Alibaba and started DMing manufacturers. What followed was weeks of back-and-forth conversations, comparing quality, pricing, packaging, and minimum order quantities across 10+ options. We eventually partnered with Maggie Ke at Guangzhou Sese Printing Co., Ltd.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Then came more rounds of prototypes, feedback, and revisions. Once we finally landed on a design we were happy with, we placed our first bulk order: 500 units.
              </p>

              <h3>The reality of physical products</h3>

              <p>
                  A few weeks later, the shipment arrived at my apartment via cargo ship. Fourteen boxes. Each weighing 45 pounds. I had to haul 600 pounds of cards upstairs lol. Thankfully, my apartment offered storage units, so I rented one out.
              </p>

              <p>
                  While we waited on prototypes and shipments, we weren't sitting idle. We bought the domain 21.cards, set up a TikTok shop and Shopify store, and booked a product photoshoot with Soona, a local Minneapolis company.
              </p>

              <h3>Going to market</h3>

              <p>
                  We marketed the same way we marketed our app, through TikTok and Instagram. Our first orders came in early 2025. Over the next few months, we sold around 100 decks at $25 each.
              </p>

              <h3>The hard decision</h3>

              <p>
                  After going through the fulfillment process, we came to a realization: this was fun, but it probably wasn't worth the time and effort given our full-time jobs. We made the hard call to shut it down and pivot to something that made more sense for us.
              </p>

              <p>
                  We didn't become millionaires from physical card decks. But we learned a ton about supply chain management, product design, marketing, and fulfillment. Most importantly, it was a fun experiment, a side quest that taught us what works and what doesn't.
