                  Supabase threw their first user conference on October 3, 2025 at Y Combinator's SF office. It brought together everyone building with Supabase, weekend hackers, production teams, and everyone in between.

                Mehul and I grabbed a Waymo down to the event (very SF). The vibe was great. I chatted with former big tech engineers now working on their own ideas, funded founders scaling their products, and hobbyists working on side projects.

                One conversation stood out. I met someone from Anon, an integration platform for AI agents. He mentioned his team was using Devin AI to automate feature development. Last I'd heard about Devin was in early 2024 when it got hit with fraud allegations and claims of overhyped performance. But from his experience, it sounded like the tool had actually become legit and was boosting their team's productivity.

                The speaker lineup was stacked, CEOs and founders from Vercel, Figma, Vanta, and Firebase. They unveiled "Multigress," their approach to Postgres at petabyte scale. Pretty cool stuff, though some of the technical details flew over my head.
              </p>

                Got some swag, made LinkedIn connections, ate free food. But honestly, the best part was just being around other people building things with Supabase. That kind of energy is motivating.
