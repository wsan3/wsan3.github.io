              <p>
                  Took a Waymo down to Y Combinator's SF offices for Supabase Select—their first dedicated user conference. The venue choice felt fitting for an event that attracted exactly the kind of people you'd expect: builders shipping real products.
              </p>

              <p>
                  The energy throughout the day was what stuck with me most. Conversations ranged from former big tech engineers who'd recently taken the leap on their own ideas, to funded founders scaling production workloads, to hobbyists tinkering on weekend projects. Everyone had skin in the game with Supabase in some way.
              </p>

              <p>
                  One memorable conversation was with someone from Anon, an integration platform for AI agents. He walked me through how his team was using Devin AI to automate feature development—practical applications of AI tooling that went beyond the usual hype.
              </p>

              <p>
                  The technical content delivered too. Paul and Ant's keynote covered their path to over a million developers and unveiled "Multigress"—their ambitious approach to Postgres at petabyte scale. Talks throughout the day dove into background workers, declarative schemas, and tighter S3 integration. The focus on scaling Postgres for modern applications felt refreshingly specific compared to most tech conferences.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Left feeling inspired by the community they've built and the technical problems they're tackling. It's rare to attend an event that strikes the right balance between substance and builder culture.
