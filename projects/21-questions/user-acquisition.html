                <h3>Building an app with full-time jobs and zero budget</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Here's the thing about building a side project: you don't have unlimited time or money. My business partner Mehul and I were both working full-time jobs, shipping code during lunch breaks and debugging at midnight. We had to be ruthless about where we spent our energy.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So when it came to launching 21 Questions, we needed to be smart about our time and resources. We went with React Native and Expo for cross-platform deployment, which let us launch simultaneously on both iOS App Store and Google Play Store. This maximized our initial market reach while keeping development manageable for two people juggling day jobs.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Understanding Our Users</h3>
                
                <p>
                    We focused heavily on the top of the conversion funnel, getting views to turn into downloads. Using TikTok and Instagram's analytics tools, we dove deep into customer segments: age ranges, geographic locations, content preferences. This data-driven approach helped us reach our current 15 million monthly viewership and 25,000 monthly installs.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We also prioritized App Store Optimization (ASO), analyzing competitors using tools like <a href="https://sensortower.com/" target="_blank">Sensor Tower</a> and <a href="https://www.apptweak.com/en" target="_blank">App Tweak</a> to improve our discoverability.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Listening to User Feedback</h3>
                
                <p>
                    We built a "Send a Suggestion" feature directly into the app where users could share feedback on how we could improve their experience. This direct line to our users proved invaluable. We iterated on their suggestions, offering more free decks to reduce friction for new users. User analytics revealed strong demand for language support, so we expanded from English-only to supporting 9 languages total, making the app accessible to our global user base.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Optimizing the Conversion Funnel</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Getting people to install was one thing. Getting them to actually start a trial was another challenge entirely. We experimented with different UI designs and onboarding flows until we nailed it, building out a flow that quickly showed the value of the app and presented the paywall after onboarding. The results: a 37% increase in trial starts and 22% boost in engagement and retention past that critical first day.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Firebase Real-Time Features</h3>
                
                <p>
                    To retain paying customers, we integrated Firebase Firestore for real-time syncing and dynamic content delivery:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time updates</strong> - New content pushed to users without app updates</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics integration</strong> - Real-time user behavior tracking for optimization</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    These Firebase-powered features let us keep the app fresh with frequent content updates, encouraging repeat usage and helping maintain strong retention metrics as our user base scaled.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Growth Channels</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Our multi-channel acquisition strategy combined:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Organic social media traffic from 200k+ follower base</li>
                    <li>App Store Optimization (ASO) for discoverability</li>
                    <li>Word-of-mouth growth from engaging gameplay</li>
                    <li>Strategic content marketing generating 15M+ monthly views</li>
                </ul>
