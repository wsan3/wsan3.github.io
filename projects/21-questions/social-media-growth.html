                    Growing 21 Questions meant figuring out how to get people to actually care about question cards on the internet. We started with zero followers and no clue what would work.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Making content people wanted to share</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The strategy: show the app in action, not just talk about it. We created videos of couples and friends actually using the questions, real reactions, real conversations. Tailored everything to fit each platform's vibe, with heavy focus on TikTok and Instagram Reels where our audience lived.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Building community, not just followers</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Consistency mattered. We posted regularly, replied to comments, and paid attention to what people responded to. When users told us what they wanted to see, we made it. That two-way conversation turned followers into advocates who'd share our stuff organically.
                </p>
                
                <h3>The results</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>200k+ followers across platforms</li>
                    <li>15M+ monthly views</li>
                    <li>Became our primary growth channel</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Social media ended up being cheaper and more effective than paid ads. When you make content people actually want to share, they do the marketing for you.
