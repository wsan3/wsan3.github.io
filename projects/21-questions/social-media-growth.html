                <p>
                  Growing 21 Questions meant figuring out how to get people to actually care about question cards on the internet. We started with zero followers and no clue what would work.
                </p>

                <h3>Finding what worked through trial and error</h3>
                
                <p>
                    We experimented with different content styles early on. We tried partnering with other social media accounts to cross-promote, tested out UGC content for a bit (which proved expensive and hard to scale), and kept iterating until something clicked.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    What eventually worked? A simple, repeatable format. We'd grab a photo from Pinterest of a couple in some setting, overlay a few questions from the app, add trending audio, throw in the most relevant hashtags, and post daily. This slideshow format became our bread and butter because it was low-effort to produce but resonated with people.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The strategy: show the app in action, not just talk about it. Real reactions, real conversations. We tailored everything to fit each platform's vibe, with heavy focus on TikTok and Instagram Reels where our audience lived.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Optimizing for what actually mattered</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Views were great, but we quickly learned to dig deeper. We analyzed which posts got the most watch time, shares, and comments, then doubled down on those content styles. We created playlists to organize content by question categories, making it easier for people to find what they wanted.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Building community, not just followers</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Consistency mattered. We posted regularly, replied to comments, and paid attention to what people responded to. When users told us what they wanted to see, we made it. That two-way conversation turned followers into advocates who'd share our stuff organically.
                </p>
                
                <h3>The results</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>200k+ followers across platforms</li>
                    <li>15M+ monthly views</li>
                    <li>5+ accounts across <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@21_questions" target="_blank">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/21questionscards/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li>
                    <li>Became our primary growth channel</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Social media ended up being cheaper and more effective than paid ads. When you make content people actually want to share, they do the marketing for you.
